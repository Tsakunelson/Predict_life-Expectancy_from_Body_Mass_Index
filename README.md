# Predict_life-Expectancy_from_Body_Mass_Index
Predicting life expectancy given body mass index using Linear Regression model 

This Project takes as Input a CSV file containing three columns (Country, Life Expectancy and Body_mass_index) of real world data description of 164 samples. 

A linear Regression model is created, then compared with that from SKlearn, which are used to fit the input data for training.

The Resulting weights are collects, then used to further predict the life expectancy any person (in the given stated countries), given His/Her Body mass Index.
